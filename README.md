# cmus jukebox
Simple mobile friendly web based cmus frontend for adding songs from library to queue. Duplicates are avoided. Search is done on the client side, so a Raspberry Pi 1 should be enough even with a large library and many users.

Flask is the only requirement. (Unless you count cmus, duh.)

Uses purecss and fuse.js via cdns.
